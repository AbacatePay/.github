## Getting Help

We offer support through the following channels:

### Documentation (First Stop)

Before asking for help, please check:

- Official documentation
- README files of the relevant repository or package
- Examples and usage guides

Most common questions are already answered there.

### Bug Reports & Feature Requests

If you believe you’ve found a bug or want to suggest an improvement:

- Open a **GitHub Issue** in the relevant repository
- Follow the provided issue templates
- Include as much context as possible (environment, versions, logs, steps to reproduce)

Please **do not** use Issues for general questions or support requests.

---

### Questions & Usage Help

For general questions, usage help, or implementation guidance:

- Use **GitHub Discussions** (when enabled on the repository)
- Clearly describe what you’re trying to achieve and what you’ve already tried

This helps maintainers and other community members assist you more effectively.
